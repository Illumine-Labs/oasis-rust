## Google, Microsoft Take Refuge in Rust Language's Better

> Google 和 微软 寻求 Rust 语言的更好安全庇护
> 越来越多的科技巨头开始采用Rust编程语言，因为它具备内置的内存安全和其他安全特性。

当 Fortanix 在 2016 年推出时，公司做出了一个决定：它将致力于使用一岁的 Rust 编程语言，以从其安全性和性能方面受益。

七年后，Fortanix对Rust的承诺证明是成功的。该公司已经为Intel Software Guard Extensions（SGX）构建了支持，这使得可以使用安全隔离区来保护用户数据，并且从Rust编译器的能力中受益，可以避免某些类别的漏洞，尤其是内存安全问题。

数据安全公司的技术副总裁兼CISO Jethro Beekman表示: “有一些早期采用者真的看到了这个潜力，在进行了一些深入研究并获得了一些实际经验后，我们决定基本上全力以赴，这个工具和编译器真的能帮助你避免错误。”

微软：
- 用 Rust 重写内核的部分功能。用Rust创建了DWriteCore，将字体解析转化为内存安全功能，并且目前正在尝试使用Rust编写图形驱动接口（GDI）的部分。在代码的早期版本中，该公司已经看到性能提升了5%至15%。

## DefCon: Hacking group plans system to encrypt social media and other apps

> [顶级黑客组织出手，将推出新的反数据收集开源框架Veilid：用Rust编写，已有10万行代码](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/DPYFvDU4GQMSUB616YpM1A)

The group, Cult of the Dead Cow, has developed a coding framework that can be used by app developers who are willing to embrace strong encryption and forsake revenue from advertising that is targeted to individuals based on detailed profiles gleaned from the data most apps now routinely collect.

The team is building on the work of such free products as Signal, which offers strong encryption for text messages and voice calls, and Tor, which offers anonymous web surfing by routing traffic through a series of servers to disguise the location of the person conducting the search.

The latest effort, to be detailed at the massive annual Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas next week, seeks to provide a foundation for messaging, file sharing and even social networking apps without harvesting any data, all secured by the kind of end-to-end encryption that makes interception hard even for governments.

Called Veilid, pronounced vay-lid, the code can be used by developers to build applications for mobile devices or the web. Those apps will pass fully encrypted content to one another using the Veilid protocol, its developers say. As with the file-sharing software BitTorrent, which distributes different pieces of the same content simultaneously, the network will get faster as more devices join and share the load, the developers say. In such decentralized “peer-to-peer” networks, users download data from one another instead of from a central machine.

As with some other open-source endeavors, the challenge will come in persuading programmers and engineers to devote time to designing apps that are compatible with Veilid. Though developers could charge money for those apps or sell ads, the potential revenue streams are limited by the inability to collect detailed information that has become a primary method for distributing targeted ads or pitching a product to a specific set of users.
