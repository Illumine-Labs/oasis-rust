# Security

## Rust Foundation

### Painter

- 2023.08 release

the Rust Foundation’s first open source project, born out of our Security Initiative.

Painter creates a call graph across all crates in order to better understand how they relate to each other & eliminate risks.

> Painter 创建一个调用图，跨越所有的板条箱，以便更好地理解它们之间的关系，并消除风险。
